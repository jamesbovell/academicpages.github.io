Situtation
======
During my grade 12 computer science class, we had to create an app of a game of our choice with a certain theme and a bit of a twist to the game. What I created was an easter themed tic tac toe game but with the twist being you can switch the opponents bunny to your own color bunny up to three times in a game.

Task
======
My teacher gave us tips and starter code for running the game and taught how to do certain things such as setting a background to the screen prior to the project. Creating a simple game from scratch was difficult at first because I didn't have much prior coding experience and I didn't realize at first how much work it actually took to create a simple game. The goal of the class project was to design a game with a theme consistent throughout the game.

Action
======
With the assistance of my teacher, and spending hours coding, I was able to create an android app game where your able to select your background, navigate through different screens back and forth, and switch your opponents bunny with a restriction up to three times, resulting in a final grade of 95% on the project.

Result
======
Below showcases the feature to change your background, gameplay, the win screen, the restriction of only being able to switch the other players bunny up to three times, and showcasing how the different backgrounds work for each screen.
